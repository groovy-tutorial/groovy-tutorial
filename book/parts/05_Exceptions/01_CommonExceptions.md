title:	Common Exceptions

The exceptions I've used in this chapter are all declared in the `java.lang` package.

Whilst you can write your own Exceptions (they're just objects after all), you should look to the pre-packaged ones and see if they meet your needs. Alternatively, consider if you can write a subclass that provides refinement to an existing exception rather than just extending `Exception`.
