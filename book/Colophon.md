A number of technologies were used in the production of this book - most of them are open source:

- The text has been prepared in the [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) format.
- The [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) editor was used to create the Mardown text.
- The [Groovy/Grails Tool Suite](http://grails.org/products/ggts) was used to test the sample code.
